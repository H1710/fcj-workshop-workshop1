## Building a 3-Tier Application with Node.js, Express, EC2, AWS ElastiCache, and AWS RDS

In this workshop, we will build a 3-tier web application using Node.js and Express. The application will be deployed on AWS EC2, with ElastiCache to enhance performance through caching, and RDS (Relational Database Service) to manage the database.

A **3-tier architecture** is a commonly used architectural model, divided into three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This is the user interface of the application, which could be a website or mobile app.
2. **Application Layer**: This contains the business logic of the application, typically implemented in server-side languages such as Node.js.
3. **Data Layer**: This stores the application's data, usually in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

In this workshop, we will use:

- **Node.js and Express** for the application layer.
- **AWS EC2** instances to host the Node.js application.
- **AWS RDS** to manage the relational database.
- **AWS ElastiCache** to store cached data, improving data access performance.

Through this workshop, you'll learn how to deploy a complete web application and optimize its performance using AWS services.
